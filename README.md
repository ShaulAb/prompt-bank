## üöÄ Key Features

- **Save Prompts Instantly**: Select any text and save it as a prompt with a title, description, and category using a simple keyboard shortcut (`Ctrl+Shift+S`).
- **Intuitive Sidebar View**: Browse and manage all your prompts in a hierarchical tree view right in the VS Code Explorer. Categories show prompt counts, and you can click any prompt to insert it instantly.
- **Powerful Search**: Find the exact prompt you need in seconds with a fuzzy search that scans titles, content, descriptions, and categories.
- **Modern & Usable Editor**: Create and edit prompts in a clean, two-column webview editor with a dynamic dropdown for selecting or creating categories on the fly.
- **Full Context Menu Support**: Right-click on any prompt or category in the tree view to access all actions: Edit, Insert, Delete, Duplicate, and Rename Category.
- **Inline Actions**: Use the convenient inline icons in the tree view to insert or delete prompts with a single click.
- **Share & Import Prompts**: Easily share your prompts with others via a public link and import prompts shared by other users.
- **Usage Tracking**: Prompts are automatically sorted by usage, so your most frequently used templates are always at the top.
- **Project-Specific & Global Storage**: Keep prompts specific to a project within its `.vscode` directory or store them globally to access them across all your projects.
- **Centralized & Reliable**: All core logic for prompt insertion and category management is centralized, ensuring consistent behavior and data integrity.
