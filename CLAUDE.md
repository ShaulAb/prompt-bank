# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Prompt Bank is a VS Code extension for managing, reusing, and sharing AI prompts. It provides a tree view in the explorer sidebar where users can save prompts organized by categories, and features drag-and-drop support, cloud sharing via GitHub OAuth, and a modern webview editor interface.

### Testing in VS Code

## Architecture

### Core Services
- **PromptService** (`src/services/promptService.ts`): Central business logic for managing prompts, handles CRUD operations and import/export
- **AuthService** (`src/services/authService.ts`): Google OAuth authentication for sharing features via Supabase
- **ShareService** (`src/services/shareService.ts`): Handles creating and fetching shared prompts via Supabase backend
- **WebViewCache** (`src/webview/WebViewCache.ts`): Caching system for WebView HTML and categories

### Storage Layer
- **FileStorageProvider** (`src/storage/fileStorage.ts`): Manages persistence to JSON files with atomic write operations
- Stores in `.vscode/prompt-bank/prompts.json` (workspace) or `~/.vscode-prompt-bank/prompts.json` (global)

### UI Components
- **PromptTreeProvider** (`src/views/promptTreeProvider.ts`): Manages the tree view in sidebar with drag-and-drop support
- **PromptEditorPanel** (`src/webview/PromptEditorPanel.ts`): WebView-based editor for creating/editing prompts

### Command Registration
- Commands are registered in `src/commands/index.ts`, `src/commands/treeCommands.ts`, and `src/commands/contextMenuCommands.ts`
- Key commands: `savePrompt`, `savePromptFromSelection`, `insertPrompt`, `listPrompts`, `importPrompt`, `shareCollection`
- **New**: `savePromptFromSelection` - Right-click context menu command for saving selected text as prompt

## Key Patterns

1. **Prompt Content Source**: The extension can capture prompts from either editor selection or clipboard (fallback), implemented in `PromptService.getPromptContent()`

2. **Context Menu Save Flow**: Right-click on selected text → "Save Selection as Prompt" → Opens WebView modal with prefilled content → User fills metadata → Saves prompt

3. **Direct Save Method**: `PromptService.savePromptDirectly()` allows saving prompts without user dialogs, used by WebView editor

4. **Conflict Resolution**: When importing prompts, automatic conflict resolution handles duplicate titles by appending numbers

5. **Tree View Updates**: After any data modification, call `treeProvider.refresh()` to update the UI

6. **WebView Communication**: Uses message passing between extension and WebView for prompt editing

7. **Authentication Flow**: Uses VS Code URI handler for Google OAuth callback, stores tokens securely in VS Code secrets. URI scheme detection uses `vscode.env.uriScheme` for cross-editor compatibility

8. **WebView Modal Modes**: `PromptEditorPanel` supports both edit mode (for existing prompts) and create mode (for new prompts with optional initial content)

9. **Commit Conventions**: Use conventional commits with emojis for automatic version management. See CONTRIBUTING.md for detailed guidelines. Examples:
   - `feat(auth): ✨ add OAuth integration` (minor bump)
   - `fix(editor): 🐛 resolve loading issue` (patch bump)
   - `feat(api)!: ✨ redesign storage system` (major bump)

## Testing Approach

Uses Vitest with behavior-based testing. Tests are isolated per feature (create, update, delete, etc.) in separate files under `test/` directory.

## TypeScript Configuration

- Strict mode enabled with all strict checks
- Target ES2022, CommonJS modules
- Source maps enabled for debugging
- Path alias `@/*` maps to `src/*`

## Recent Achievements

- Successfully implemented "Save Selection as Prompt" context menu feature
- Enhanced WebView editor with performance optimizations and caching

- Optimized WebView loading performance with caching system
- Bundle size: 39.8kb minified

### Documentation

- Maintained comprehensive CONTRIBUTING.md guide
- Enhanced inline code documentation

## Version Management & Release Process

### Automated Version Bumping (Implemented)
The project uses **standard-version** for semantic versioning based on conventional commits:

1. **Commit Convention Impact**:
   - `fix:` commits → Patch version (0.0.x)
   - `feat:` commits → Minor version (0.x.0)
   - `BREAKING CHANGE:` → Major version (x.0.0)

2. **Release Workflows**:
   - **version-bump.yml**: Manual trigger for version bumps, creates PR with changelog
   - **release.yml**: Publishes to VS Code Marketplace after version bump

3. **How to Release**:
   ```bash
   # Local testing
   npm run release:dry-run  # Preview what will change

   # GitHub Actions (Recommended)
   # 1. Go to Actions tab → "Version Bump" workflow
   # 2. Select version type (auto/patch/minor/major)
   # 3. Review and merge the created PR
   # 4. Use "Release" workflow to publish
   ```

4. **Important**: The system uses `.versionrc.json` configuration that recognizes emoji commits. DO NOT modify version numbers manually in package.json - always use the release scripts or workflows.

## Next Steps / Potential Improvements
