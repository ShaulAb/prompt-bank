# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Prompt Bank is a VS Code extension for managing, reusing, and sharing AI prompts. It provides a tree view in the explorer sidebar where users can save prompts organized by categories, and features drag-and-drop support, cloud sharing via GitHub OAuth, and a modern webview editor interface.

## Architecture

### Core Services
- **PromptService** (`src/services/promptService.ts`): Central business logic for managing prompts, handles CRUD operations and import/export
- **AuthService** (`src/services/authService.ts`): Google OAuth authentication for sharing features via Supabase
- **ShareService** (`src/services/shareService.ts`): Handles creating and fetching shared prompts via Supabase backend
- **WebViewCache** (`src/webview/WebViewCache.ts`): Caching system for WebView HTML and categories

### Storage Layer
- **FileStorageProvider** (`src/storage/fileStorage.ts`): Manages persistence to JSON files with atomic write operations
- Stores in `.vscode/prompt-bank/prompts.json` (workspace) or `~/.vscode-prompt-bank/prompts.json` (global)

### UI Components
- **PromptTreeProvider** (`src/views/promptTreeProvider.ts`): Manages the tree view in sidebar with drag-and-drop support
- **PromptEditorPanel** (`src/webview/PromptEditorPanel.ts`): WebView-based editor for creating/editing prompts

### Command Registration
- Commands are registered in `src/commands/index.ts`, `src/commands/treeCommands.ts`, and `src/commands/contextMenuCommands.ts`
- Key commands: `savePrompt`, `savePromptFromSelection`, `insertPrompt`, `listPrompts`, `importPrompt`, `shareCollection`
- **New**: `savePromptFromSelection` - Right-click context menu command for saving selected text as prompt

## Key Patterns

1. **Prompt Content Source**: The extension can capture prompts from either editor selection or clipboard (fallback), implemented in `PromptService.getPromptContent()`

2. **Context Menu Save Flow**: Right-click on selected text ‚Üí "Save Selection as Prompt" ‚Üí Opens WebView modal with prefilled content ‚Üí User fills metadata ‚Üí Saves prompt

3. **Direct Save Method**: `PromptService.savePromptDirectly()` allows saving prompts without user dialogs, used by WebView editor

4. **Conflict Resolution**: When importing prompts, automatic conflict resolution handles duplicate titles by appending numbers

5. **Tree View Updates**: After any data modification, call `treeProvider.refresh()` to update the UI

6. **WebView Communication**: Uses message passing between extension and WebView for prompt editing

7. **Authentication Flow**: Uses VS Code URI handler for Google OAuth callback, stores tokens securely in VS Code secrets. URI scheme detection uses `vscode.env.uriScheme` for cross-editor compatibility

8. **WebView Modal Modes**: `PromptEditorPanel` supports both edit mode (for existing prompts) and create mode (for new prompts with optional initial content)

9. **Commit Conventions**: Use conventional commits with emojis for automatic version management. See CONTRIBUTING.md for detailed guidelines. Examples:
   - `feat(auth): ‚ú® add OAuth integration` (minor bump)
   - `fix(editor): üêõ resolve loading issue` (patch bump)
   - `feat(api)!: ‚ú® redesign storage system` (major bump)

## Testing Approach

Uses Vitest with behavior-based testing. Tests are isolated per feature (create, update, delete, etc.) in separate files under `test/` directory.

## TypeScript Configuration

- Strict mode enabled with all strict checks
- Target ES2022, CommonJS modules
- Source maps enabled for debugging
- Path alias `@/*` maps to `src/*`

## Version Management & Release Process

### Dev-Centered Release Workflow (Implemented)
The project uses a **dev-centered workflow** with automated version bumping and manual publishing control:

```
Features ‚Üí dev ‚Üí [Version Bump] ‚Üí [Local Test] ‚Üí main ‚Üí [Marketplace]
```

#### **Branch Strategy**:
- **Feature branches**: Development of individual features
- **dev branch**: Integration branch where features are merged and releases are prepared
- **main branch**: Stable/released code only, represents what users have

#### **Release Philosophy**:
- **Automated preparation**: Version bumping, changelog generation, VSIX packaging happen on `dev`
- **Manual verification**: Local testing of VSIX before committing to release
- **Controlled publishing**: Manual marketplace publishing with full oversight

### **Commit Convention Impact**:
- `fix:` commits ‚Üí Patch version (0.0.x)
- `feat:` commits ‚Üí Minor version (0.x.0)
- `BREAKING CHANGE:` ‚Üí Major version (x.0.0)

### **Release Workflows**:
- **version-bump.yml**: Manual trigger for version bumps, creates PR with changelog to dev
- **release.yml**: Creates GitHub release with VSIX file on dev branch (no auto-publishing)

### **Complete Release Process**:

#### **Step 1: Prepare Release on Dev**
```bash
# Local testing (optional)
npm run release:dry-run  # Preview what will change

# GitHub Actions (Recommended)
# 1. Go to Actions tab ‚Üí "Version Bump" workflow
# 2. Select version type (auto/patch/minor/major)
# 3. Review and merge the created PR to dev
# 4. Use "Release" workflow to create GitHub release with VSIX
```

#### **Step 2: Local Testing**
```bash
# Download VSIX from GitHub release
code --install-extension prompt-bank-X.X.X.vsix  # Test locally
# Verify all functionality works as expected
```

#### **Step 3: Release to Production**
```bash
# Create PR from dev to main
gh pr create --base main --head dev --title "Release v0.X.Y"

# After review and merge to main:
vsce publish  # Publish to VS Code Marketplace
# Optional: npx ovsx publish --pat <token>  # Publish to Open VSX
```

### **Benefits of This Workflow**:
- **Safety**: Local testing before committing to release
- **Quality**: PR review for all releases (dev ‚Üí main)
- **Control**: Manual marketplace publishing timing
- **Clarity**: Clean separation between development and released code
- **History**: Main branch represents actual release history

### **Important Notes**:
- The system uses `.versionrc.json` configuration that recognizes emoji commits
- DO NOT modify version numbers manually in package.json - always use the release scripts or workflows
- Git tags are created on dev during version bump, then pushed to main during release
- All release artifacts (VSIX, changelog) are prepared on dev branch for testing

## Next Steps / Potential Improvements
